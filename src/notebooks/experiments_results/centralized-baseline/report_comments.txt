a first experiment was carried out to evaluate how different parameters influence the leanring curve.
the experiments were carried out at a fixed seed and a small number of epochs (5).

(V8)

purpose: effect of momentum and weight decay at different learning rates, given a fixed batch size

batch_size fixed = 128, 
momentum = [0.8, 0.9]
wd = [0.0005, 0, 0.001, 0.0001]
lr = [0.001, 0.005, 0.01]

we noticed that , for all learning rates:

weight decay: little or no effect - therefore we choose to fix it to 5e-4, which is not the best for all learning rates but the difference in accuracy is very small by changing the weight decay

momentum: small effect but visible - best momentum 0.9 for all lr values



(V14)

and we carry out the final experiments by further varying the lr, and also varying the epochs (too see how much gain in accuracy we have bychoosing a higher number of epochs)
